# computer-graphics-c-plus-plus

This repository contains all the university work I have towards the third-year computer graphics course at the University of Canterbury

## Best Example Projects

To view two self-driven projects I had worked towards, I would recommend looking at `Alien Invasion` which uses the OpelGL fixed pipeline to create a scripted scene.

The second project to look at is the `Ray Tracing` directory. This directory contains a ray-traced scene using only a single thread on the processor to create a
near-photo realistic scene of geometric shapes with reflections, refraction and transparency.

### Items to Note
Whilst the projects are written in C++, the `Alien Invasion` project is written using C syntax.
The `Ray Tracing` directory is a closer representation of my existing C++ knowledge/application as of the end of 2019.
